// GenerateNBlocks generates blocks on an as needed basis to extend the main
// chain by the requested number of blocks in the discrete mining mode and
// returns a list of hashes of the blocks that ultimately extended the main
// chain, regardless of their origin.
//
// The aforementioned distinction regarding the origin of the returned hashes is
// important to note because the blocks that ultimately extend the main chain
// may be different from the blocks generated since blocks from other sources
// may arrive while the discrete mining process is underway leading to
// generation of more or less blocks than the target number.
//
// A best effort attempt is made to avoid as many forks as possible by
// discarding any locally-mined blocks that would knowingly cause a fork with
// blocks that arrive from other sources and to only generate as many blocks as
// are necessary to achieve extending the main chain by the specified number of
// blocks.  However, forks may still occur since it is not always possible to
// detect forks beforehand.  Nevertheless, any such forks will not count towards
// the requested number of blocks since they do not extend the main chain.
//
// Only one instance of discrete mining may be active at once.  An active
// discrete mining instance may be canceled by specifying 0 for the number of
// blocks.  A canceled instance will return [ErrCancelDiscreteMining].
//
// Specifying 0 for the number of blocks when there are no active discrete
// mining instances has no effect.
//
// An error will be returned when either normal mining is active or when a
// discrete mining instance is already active and the specified number of blocks
// is not 0.
//
// It makes use of a subscription to the background block template generator to
// obtain the templates and attempts to solve them while automatically switching
// to new templates as they become available as needed.  As a result, it
// supports many of the nice features of the template subscriptions such as
// giving all votes a chance to arrive and automatically switching to templates
// building on new blocks that arrive from other sources.
